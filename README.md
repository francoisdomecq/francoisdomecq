Hi There !

My name is François Domecq, I am a french engineering student at the ENSC (Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Bordeaux) in Bordeaux. During my studies at the ENSC, I have been introduced to cognitive sciences. It is a domain which combines computer science, Artificial intelligence, and of course human factors. In my first and second year, I had the opportunity to lead computer science projects of any kind (web programming, mobile programming, game programming..). 

My main programming languages are C# (ASP .Net Core), JavaScript (React, ReactNative, Node.Js) and Python. But I am still looking to improve myself as a coder, so I try to constantly learn new things. 

As a future cognitive engineer, I also have abilities in UX design and human system interface. It led me to master Figma, so I can make mock-ups for my different projects.
